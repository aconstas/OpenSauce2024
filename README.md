# Open Sauce

*August 31st, 2024*

## Description

Open bot.ino in the Arduino IDE.

For each library, you need to create a .cpp file and .h file.
The pins.h file should be the only file that defines the pins used for the device.
The .h file should define available functions and variables.
The .cpp file should implement the functions and variables. This file should probably include `#include pins.h` and `#include` the .h file.
